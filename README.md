## Third-Party-APIs: Work Day Scheduler

## User Story
As an employee with a busy schedule, I want to add important events to a daily planner so that I can manage my time effectively.

## Project Criteria
To create a work-day planner that uses third-party API's such as jQuery, moment.js, and Bootstrap. Parts of the application will change dynamically depending on the current time and day. The planner should also be able to save any tasks entered into the text area fields to local storage.

I am using a daily planner to create a schedule:
- I open the planner the current day and time is displayed at the top of the calendar.
- When I scroll down, I am presented with timeblocks for business hours
- I view the timeblocks for that day
- Each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
- I click into a timeblock and I can enter an event
- I click the save button for that timeblock, then the text for that event is saved in local storage
- When I refresh the page then the saved events persist.
- If I did not click the save button for the event, will not be saved when I refresh
- Click on "Clear Day" button to top of page to clear the day
