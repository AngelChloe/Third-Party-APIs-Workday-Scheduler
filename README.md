Third-Party-APIs: Work Day Scheduler

Task:

To create a work-day planner that uses third-party API's such as jQuery, moment.js, and Bootstrap. Parts of the application will change dynamically depending on the current time and day. The planner should also be able to save any tasks entered into the text area fields to local storage.

As an employee with a busy schedule, I want to add important events to a daily planner so that I can manage my time effectively.


Acceptance Criteria

I am using a daily planner to create a schedule:
- I open the planner the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar.
-  When I scroll down, I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours
- I view the timeblocks for that day 
- Each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
- I click into a timeblock and I can enter an event
- I click the save button for that timeblock, then the text for that event is saved in local storage
- When I refresh the page then the saved events persist.

How to Use
Once you've opened the application, click on any text area to the right of the hour you wish to create a task. Then, type out the task that you want and click the save button on the end of the row.

The following is a screen shot of my project.  It goes all the way to 10:00 PM but could not capture all of it.
